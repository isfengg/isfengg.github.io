    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have already set the trace speed to the hightest level in system perferences, and you still feel the mouse move slowly. Here is a tip!</p><p>First, check your speed level in terminal.</p><pre><code class="lang-bash">defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling</code></pre><p>The result should be 3. And I strongly recommand you set the number between 6 and 8, or it is too fast to control. Run the code below in terminal.</p><pre><code class="lang-bash">defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling 7</code></pre><p>This setting will not make effect until you restart your machine.</p><p>Next time, you still can use this method to change the speed level. Or in system perferences, the highest level still is 3.</p><p>In this way, the track pad would not be affected.</p>]]></content>
